# 👋 Hi, I'm Monique Moguel

🎯 GRC & Cloud Security | Risk-Driven | Business-Aligned | Purpose-Built

Welcome. This GitHub is where I document my work, share projects, and build in public as I grow in cybersecurity with a focus on Governance, Risk & Compliance (GRC) and secure cloud architecture.

I'm committed to bridging the gap between compliance and practical security, building systems that not only meet frameworks and standards but actually reduce risk and support business goals. My work here reflects that mission — clear, accountable, and built to scale.

Thanks for visiting. Let’s build systems that make sense — secure by default, responsible by design.
