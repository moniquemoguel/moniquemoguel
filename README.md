#  Hi, I'm Monique Moguel

 GRC, Cloud Security & AI Governance | Risk-Driven | Business-Aligned | Purpose-Built

Welcome. This GitHub is where I document my work, share projects, and build in public as I grow in cybersecurity with a focus on Governance, Risk & Compliance (GRC), secure cloud architecture and the emerging field of AI Governance.

I'm committed to bridging the gap between compliance and practical security, building systems and policies that not only meet frameworks and standards, but actually reduce risk, ensure responsible AI adoption and support business goals. My work here reflects that mission; clear, accountable, and built to scale.

Thanks for visiting. Letâ€™s build systems that make sense. Secure by default, responsible by design.
